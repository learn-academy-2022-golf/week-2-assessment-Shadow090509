# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is what something does or in which situation it does it and an argument is something that invokes the method.

Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable(kind of like a place holder) that is used to import arguments into functions.
Arguments are the values passed to the function.
I'm understanding that the main difference between parameters and arguments is the parameters are the names listed in the definition of the function and become the value of the argument supplied.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() will find and create a new array with the specific parameters given. Value type,index and array. value type is required.

Researched answer: The .map() method seems to be used to iterate over an array and/or call a function on every element specified in the array
though index and arr are not required, the can be used to specifically iterate over a specific index or array. though it seems like the value will be enough in most cases to accomplish the desired task.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map will call a function on the element specified in an arrray while the filter method will create a new array withe the specific elements chosen. i think the main difference is that filter makes a new smaller list with what is chosen from an array and map will call a function on the elements of an array you choose

Researched answer: map will create a new array with the results after calling on a function for every element specified. while filter creates a new array with the elements that share a common characteristic. map allows items in an array to be manipulated or changed returning the changed item in a new array. while filter can identify specific items in an array that share similar characteristics and returning them in a new array.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: My understanding of iteration is that it does something over and over again until the desired result is met or the duration of the command(which is predetermined) is exhausted.

Researched answer: I have concluded that iteration in javascript is best observed and understood in the "iteration statements" also refered to as loops. iteration in javascript seems to refer to a repetitive task that is commonly done through an array while at the same time not actually repeating it's self, more specificaly with different inputs each time.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class has properties and values that are applicable to many objects. and objects are individual instances of a class(has properties from a class). An object has properties from a class, while a class has properties an object can use.

Researched answer: In my own words, A class is the "blueprint" of an object. An object uses the blueprint from the class to build upon. More simply put, a class is like a gallon of milk used for multiple bowls of cereal. Each bowl contains milk from the same class, yet the bowls and amount or type of cereal will and can be different for each serving.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Shot in the dark. I would think it is some way to pick something up and move it to somewhere else, either in the same file or to/from another file.

Researched answer: The movement of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope. I'm not sure if this will change the behavior of the object or if it's just easier to invoke the command of the specific "hoisted" (function, variable, class) in the situation there is more than one of each of these methods.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: An end goal from a user's perspective in order to build the framework or blueprint of the actual project.

2. Spread operator: Along with JS ES6 this operation takes an array and makes it into individual elements.

3. React: The best and important part is that it is free! open source (which i am under the impression still means free). A javascript framework and library Made by Facebook. Utilized to build interactive web applications and user interfaces.

4. React props: This seems to refer to the properties created inside of react for an object.

5. DOM events: A Document Object Model is designed to react When the user clicks with their mouse, hovers over elements, or uses their keyboard to type and will focus the scope of its view to the cursor's position.
